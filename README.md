Hi! I'm eliza:)

I love logic puzzles and problem solving and finding ways to make systems work better for people. I'm currently studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Human-Computer Interaction at BYU, and I'll be graduating in April of 2027. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing guitar and banjo, organizing backyard concerts, running and hiking in the mountains, and gathering with friends and family. I aim to make the world a kinder and more whimsical place.

## some fun projects
### [the Ladybug Game](https://github.com/Eliza-Surpriza/ladybug_game)
I built an interactive text based implementation of a board game I grew up playing with my sisters.
### [chess server](https://github.com/Eliza-Surpriza/chess)
I built a chess server that can host multiple games of chess, highlight possible moves, and declare winners.
### [focus timer](https://github.com/Eliza-Surpriza/focus-timer)
I learned about the basics of web development while creating a focus timer to keep track of how much time I spend on different projects and assignments

## experience
### academic advising team lead
I lead a team of six peer academic and career advisors at BYU's CS Belonging Office. We help students prepare for internships and plan schedules and provide a space for everyone to belong in the CS program.
### QA testing internship
I worked with the software team at Eddy this summer to test new features and look for bugs in existing features.
### computer science TA
I TAed for the intro programming class for two years, teaching lab sections and mentoring individual students.
